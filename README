Binary Search Examples

Problem: Given a sorted array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

*Binary Search on Arrays*
*You are given a sorted array of integers (in increasing order) and
* a target. Your task is to find the index of the target in the given
* array in O(lgn). A function prototype has been provided, just fill
* out the body.

*Merging Two Arrays*
*You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large
* enough buffer at the end to hold B. Complete the function
* 'merge' to merge B into A in sorted order.
